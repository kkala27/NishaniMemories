			<p>Ahhh After a small yet large(in its own way) relationship of approx 2 years we got married on 1st Dec 2021.<br><br> I know you always have a complaint that I have ruined this relationship at a very early stage but trust me for me it was a roller coaster. When it started I was under the impression that I am ready for a serious relationship but I was not I was still a child who dosen't care about others and wanted to stay in his own comfort zone but as the relationship started progressing I tend to realize there is a lot in me to change to make this work and out of shear stress I told my parents about you to put a label on it or you can say to make it official.<br><br>
			This was my pathetic way to save our relationship since I knew once everything is official I will do whatever I can to save it and thats what I tried to do.  know i failed majorly on every aspect of the relationship but my only success was this day.<br><br>
			Lets live a long and a beautiful life together and I know I have to keep working hard so that one day I can say "Kshitiz Kala is the best boyfriend ever....."  </p>
