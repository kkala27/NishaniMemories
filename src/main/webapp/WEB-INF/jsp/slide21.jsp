			<p>Another one from our GOA Trip. This is one of my favourite picture of us.<br><br> Talking about the day it was our last day in Goa we went to that fancy restaurant and there was a old couple sitting there busy on there phones and you were like this is what's going to happen to us as well but I am telling you that will not be the case for us.   </p>
