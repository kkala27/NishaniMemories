			<p>Another one from Goa and this was a day to remember we decided to visit North Goa on scooty and it was a long ride and once we reached there Batra forced us to do those vodka shots. Everyone handled it pretty well except for you. I knew it was a terrible idea because we had a fight just before leaving the hotel and as soon as the third shot hit you, started the unconsolable crying all the bad memories started flashing around your eyes. Damnn your BAD TRIPS !!!!! </p>
